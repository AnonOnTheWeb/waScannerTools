# WA Scanner Tools  
All scripts are written in Python 3.6.9, but **should** run on legacy versions too, with the correct pip packages.  

## Current project list  
- ~~EmergencyWA incident feedreader~~  
- EmergencyWA alert feedreader  
- Western Power outage feedreader (once I figure out how to neatly parse JSON with Python)  
- PagerMon feedreader (https://github.com/pagermon/pagermon)  
- VicEmergency incident feedreader (https://emergency.vic.gov.au/public/osom-geojson.json)  

## Required pip packages
- feedparser  
- datetime  
- json  
- requests  
  
  
Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
